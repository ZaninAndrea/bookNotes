# Computer Science Distilled, Wladston Ferreira Filho

## Basics
### Ideas
- flowcharts are a powerful tool
- you could also write pseudocode
- if you model you problem mathmatically you can leverage the work done by others in the past

### Logic
- the fundaments of formal logic are booleans, the conditional --> operator, the negation ! operator, the AND and OR operators
- remember that from A-->B doesn't follow B-->A
- AND and OR follow associativty and distributivity
- DeMorgan's Law: 
!(A AND B) = !A OR !B
!A AND !B = !(A OR B)
- we can use truth tables to represent logic statements
- logic gates perform logic operations on electric current

### Counting
- a bunch of combinatorial stuff

### Probability
- bunch of high school probability
- gambler's fallacy: thinking that past events affect the likelihood of a future independent even, e.g. that rolling 10 times 1 in a row makes a 1 less likely as 11th roll
