# Smarter Faster Better, Charles Duhigg
## Motivation
- The striatum is a central dispatch for the brain: it connects, among the others, the prefrontal cortex to the basal ganglia
    - the striatum activity is associated with emotional reactions
- motivation is a trainable skill, but requires us to feel in control to develop
    - making choices, even ones that have no benefits, increases motivation
- locus of control:
    - internal: believing you are in control
    - external: believing that your life is primarily influenced by events outside your control
    - it can be influenced through training
- you can transform a chore into a meaningful decision asking "why?", being a decision increases motivation
- the most powerful choices motivation-wise are those that convince us that we are in control and endow our actions with larger meaning

## Teams
- how a team is manged is more important that who it is made up of in determining its success
- the norms of a team are one of the most important factors in it's success
    - the best norms are those that promote psychological safety, that is the belief that the group is a safe place to take risks. It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves
- Google HR Research showed that the most effective teams share 2 characteristics:
    - all members talked for roughly the same amount of time at the end of the day
    - members have higher than average emphaty
- The group leader being a role model is a  very effective way to increase a team's psychological safety
- The 5 key norms identified in google's study are:
    - teams need to believe their work is important
    - teams need to feel their work is personally meaningful
    - teams need clear goals and defined roles
    - team members need to know they can depend on each other
    - teams need psychological safety

## Focus
- cognitive tunneling can cause people to become overly focused on whatever is right in front of their eyes or become preoccupied with immediate tasks
- creating mental models helps you focus on the right things
-  study conducted by MIT in a recruiting firm discovered that high performing employees
    - worked on max 5 projects at a time
    - took on projects in their early stages
    - loved to generate theories (i.e. mental models)
- TIP: cultivate the habit of imagining, as specifically as possible, what you expect to see

## Goal setting
- cognitive closure: the desire for a confident judgement on an issue
- high emotional need for cognitive clousre is correlated to more accomplished people
- but the need for cognitive closure introduces a bias towards fast solutions in the judgemental process
- cognitive closure is composed of 2 needs:
    - need to seize a goal when it meets the minimum treshold of acceptability. POSITIVE: it keeps us from endless debates in favour of action
    - need to freeze on an objective once selected. NEGATIVE: makes us blind to information inconsistent with our preconceptions
- SMART goals are: specific, measurables, achievable, realistic and based on a timeline
- Be Careful: goals need to be abitious too, not only SMART
- you need to balance the psychological influence of immediate goals with the freedom to think about bigger things
- many studies showd that forcing people to commit to ambitious, seemingly out-of-reach objectives (stretch goals) can spark outsized hymps in innovation and productivity
- audaciousness can be terrifying, so we have to couple it with SMART goals
- p120 image - goal setting flowchart
- stretch and SMART goals are not enough: sometimes we still need to pause and ponder whether our goals make sense

## Managing others
- most companies' cultures fall in 1 of 5 categories:
    - **star model**: investing a lot of money in hiring elite employees
    - **engineering model**: not many stars, but the egineers take the most important decisions
    - **bureaucracy model**: many ranks of managers, thick employee handbook, everything is spelled out
    - **autocracy model**: similar to above, but everything is aimed to the CEO's vision
    - **commitment model**: leaders want people to only leave when they retire or die. Slow and steady growth
- commitment culture is by far the most profitable:
    - employees are the hardest asset to find. When everyone wants to stick around you have a pretty strong advantage

## Decision making
- think about the future as a set of event that might happen
- probabilistic thinking is the ability to hold multiple, contrasting outcomes in your mind and estimate their relative odds
- to leverage our brain's incredible forecasting ability we need to be exposedto many different sample
    - one common bias is being exposed to too many successful companies and too few failed ones

## Innovation
- the highest impact science is primarily grounded in exceptionally conventional combinations of prior work yet simultaneously features an intrusion of unusual combinations
