## Motivation
- The striatum is a central dispatch for the brain: it connects, among the others, the prefrontal cortex to the basal ganglia
    - the striatum activity is associated with emotional reactions
- motivation is a trainable skill, but requires us to feel in control to develop
    - making choices, even ones that have no benefits, increases motivation
- locus of control:
    - internal: believing you are in control
    - external: believing that your life is primarily influenced by events outside your control
    - it can be influenced through training
- you can transform a chore into a meaningful decision asking "why?", being a decision increases motivation
- the most powerful choices motivation-wise are those that convince us that we are in control and endow our actions with larger meaning

## Teams
- how a team is manged is more important that who it is made up of in determining its success
- the norms of a team are one of the most important factors in it's success:
    - the best norms are those that promote psychological safety, that is the belief that the group is a safe place to take risks. It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves
