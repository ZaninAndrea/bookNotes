## Motivation
- The striatum is a central dispatch for the brain: it connects, among the others, the prefrontal cortex to the basal ganglia
    - the striatum activity is associated with emotional reactions
- motivation is a trainable skill, but requires us to feel in control to develop
    - making choices, even ones that have no benefits, increases motivation
- locus of control:
    - internal: believing you are in control
    - external: believing that your life is primarily influenced by events outside your control
    - it can be influenced through training
- you can transform a chore into a meaningful decision asking "why?", being a decision increases motivation
- the most powerful choices motivation-wise are those that convince us that we are in control and endow our actions with larger meaning

## Teams
- how a team is manged is more important that who it is made up of in determining its success
- the norms of a team are one of the most important factors in it's success
    - the best norms are those that promote psychological safety, that is the belief that the group is a safe place to take risks. It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves
- Google HR Research showed that the most effective teams share 2 characteristics:
    - all members talked for roughly the same amount of time at the end of the day
    - members have higher than average emphaty
- The group leader being a role model is a  very effective way to increase a team's psychological safety
- The 5 key norms identified in google's study are:
    - teams need to believe their work is important
    - teams need to feel their work is personally meaningful
    - teams need clear goals and defined roles
    - team members need to know they can depend on each other
    - teams need psychological safety

## Focus
- cognitive tunneling can cause people to become overly focused on whatever is right in front of their eyes or become preoccupied with immediate tasks
- creating mental models helps you focus on the right things
-  study conducted by MIT in a recruiting firm discovered that high performing employees
    - worked on max 5 projects at a time
    - took on projects in their early stages
    - loved to generate theories (i.e. mental models)
- TIP: cultivate the habit of imagining, as specifically as possible, what you expect to see

## Goal setting
- cognitive closure: the desire for a confident judgement on an issue
- high emotional need for cognitive clousre is correlated to more accomplished people
- but the need for cognitive closure introduces a bias towards fast solutions in the judgemental process
