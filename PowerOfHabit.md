# The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg
Notes starting from chapter 7.

- Shops put fruit close to the entrance, because if you buy healthy food, you are then more inclined to buy also junk food
- habits are more apt to change after major life events
- our subconscius prefers the familiar, also in the context of music, even if we consciously we think that we dislike the song
    - to contrast this effect you have to make the neww seem like the old
- the power of social obligation has been key in the Montgomery Bus Boycott
- the so called power of "weak ties" (friends of friends) was more important than close friends in getting a job, probably because it allowed to reach to networks that otherwise you wouldn't have known
