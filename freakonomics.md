The book is built on a few key ideas:
- **incentives** are the cornerstone of modern life
- conventional wisdom is often wrong
- dramatic effects often have distant, even subtle, causes
- experts use their **informational advantage** to serve their own agenda
- knowing what to measure and how to measure it makes a complicated world much less so

There are 3 types of incentives: economic, social and moral.

Incentives are always **trade-offs**. E.g. giving an economic incentive to blood donation removes the moral incentive and raising the price of blood encourages crime to circumvent the limitation or to gather blood.
