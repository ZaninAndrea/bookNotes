# Spark, The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain, John J. Ratey
## Introduction
Physical activity makes the brain function at its best. Min and body are deeply connected. Exercise releases growth factors that enhance the brain.

## Welcome to the Revolution
In Napervill students use chronometers and heart rate monitors during trainng.

Exercise puts you in a state of heightened awareness. Counselors began reccomeding students to schedules their hardest class after gym, to reap the benefits.

Naperville students scored as best in the world in the TIMSS test, while US students as a whole ranked 18th, we should consider though that Naperville students come from a demographically advantaged population.

Heart rate monitors are used to measure effort instead of results.

In Naperville they used exercise to grow urture confidence and social skills.
A mother reports a spike in confidence in her daughters.

In poor districts PE4Life had a huge impact in reducing the fights among students.

## Learning
Exercise improves mood and primes the brain for learning by improving its plasticity.

About 80% of the signaling in the brain relies on 2 neurotransmitters: glutamate (increases the activity) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, reduces activity).
On the other hand serotonin, norepinephrine and dopanine have a huge impact on the brain even if they only account for a 1% of the brain's activity:
- serotonin keeps the mood and impulsivity under control
- norepinephrine amplifies attention and motivation
- dopamine gives increases attention and satisfaction

Exercise helps to balance this neurotransmitters

Neurons that fire toghether strengthen their synapsis, BDNF increases this strengthening.

Given that brain and thought were born as a mean to coordinate movement, exercise trains not only the muscles but also the brain, e.g. the prefrontal cortex, that coordinates both the mental and physical activity.
