# Spark, The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain, John J. Ratey
## Introduction
Physical activity makes the brain function at its best. Min and body are deeply connected. Exercise releases growth factors that enhance the brain.

## Welcome to the Revolution
In Napervill students use chronometers and heart rate monitors during trainng.

Exercise puts you in a state of heightened awareness. Counselors began reccomeding students to schedules their hardest class after gym, to reap the benefits.

Naperville students scored as best in the world in the TIMSS test, while US students as a whole ranked 18th, we should consider though that Naperville students come from a demographically advantaged population.

Heart rate monitors are used to measure effort instead of results.

In Naperville they used exercise to grow urture confidence and social skills.
A mother reports a spike in confidence in her daughters.

In poor districts PE4Life had a huge impact in reducing the fights among students.

## Learning
Exercise improves mood and primes the brain for learning by improving its plasticity.

About 80% of the signaling in the brain relies on 2 neurotransmitters: glutamate (increases the activity) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, reduces activity).
On the other hand serotonin, norepinephrine and dopanine have a huge impact on the brain even if they only account for a 1% of the brain's activity:
- serotonin keeps the mood and impulsivity under control
- norepinephrine amplifies attention and motivation
- dopamine gives focuses attention and gives satisfaction

Exercise helps to balance this neurotransmitters

Neurons that fire toghether strengthen their synapsis, BDNF increases this strengthening.

Given that brain and thought were born as a mean to coordinate movement, exercise trains not only the muscles but also the brain, e.g. the prefrontal cortex, that coordinates both the mental and physical activity.

Cotman's study showed that there is a direct connection between exercise and brain function, in particular through and increase in BDNF.

If you are in good shape you can learn more **efficiently**. E.g. a study showed a 20% increase in speed of learning vocabulary words after exercise.

Several studies showed that using the brain changes it. E.g. a cat with an eye sewn close develops a smaller visual cortex. The environment can change the brain!

The myth that brain cells do not regrowth is just that: a myth.

New neurons do born but they also die if they don't "find something to do", the process of integration takes about 28 days.

In this process, *neurogenesis*, too exercise has an impact: it increases the number of cells spawning.

It was also shown that neurogenesis is key to learning.

Stress, depression and aging lower neurogenesis.

The period right after and intense (but not necessarily very long) training is perfect to study.

Aerobic exercise and complex motor skills have complementary benefits on the brain, so just running isn't enough (calistenichs seems good)

## Stress
Stress is a vague word, but above all stress is a threat to the body's equilibrium.

Small doses of stress are healthy. The saying "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger" is quite literally true.

Our brain doesn't make a clear cut between good and bad stress and in either case triggers a chain reaction releasing norepinephrine, adrenaline, increasing heart rate and blood pressure, cortisol, ...

Although still controversial the author believes that physically moving can alter our mental state.

The panic monster of the TED talk is norepinephrine and dopamine, that make us focus.

Cortisol increases glucose in the blood and channels it towards the key organs, in particular the brain.
It also triggers the storage of fats, so if you are continuously stressed you will accumulate fat, that's why some long distance runners have a fatty belly.
