# Thinking, Fast and Slow
## Introduction
Elaborates on the concept that expanding our vocabulary extends our cognitive abilities in that field, because it allows us to formulate deeper thoughts.

The book will focus on the errors in our judgement, but be aware that most of the time our thinking works well. 

One heuristic presented in the introduction is the *availability heuristic*, we rely on the ease of recollection as an estimate of likelihood.

Experts create intuitive abilities that allow for example a skilled chess player to see the strong moves at a glance. Those intuitive abilities are stunning because uncommon, but they are really akin to many intuitive abilities that we all posses, such as understanding the emotional state of someone from the first word of a sentence.

## The Characters of the Story
Our brain works in 2 modes:
- **System 1**, it's the fast, intuitive, heuristics-based, effortless thinking mode
- **System 2**, it's the slow, deliberate, logical, effortful thinking mode

Fast thinking includes both the expert thinking and the heuristic thinking.
The essence of the intuitive heuristics is that when faced with a hard question we answer an easier different one.

Mental abilities can become fast and automatic with practice, for example reading.

System 1 cannot be disabled, the best we can do is learn to recognize when our intuition falls prey to biases and ignore those faulty intuitions relying only on System 2.
