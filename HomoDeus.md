# Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari
## The New Human Agenda
The advancements made in the 20th century reduced greatly famine, sickness and wars: for every person that dies of human violence 2 do because of diabetes.

> sugar is now more dangerous than gunpowder

Having raised humanity above the beastly level of survival struggles, ==we will now aim to upgrade humans into gods==.

This inevitable quest will hugely change our social structure: new generations will have a much harder time replacing the older ones. 
Furthermore the prize of eternal life might spark conflict never hitherto seen.

Humans will also try to find the key to happiness, because what is an eternal life good for if you aren't happy? People are already trying to achieve happiness via chemical drugs.

All this book is of course only speculation, maybe politics or something else will stop this quest like they prevented the Atomic Holocaust.
The more information we acquire the less accurate the prediction becomes, because that information will lead to unpredictable futures. This is the **paradox of knowledge**:

> Imagine, for example, that one day experts decipher the basic laws of the economy. Once this happens, banks, governments, investors and customer  will begin to use this knowledge to act in novel ways, and gain an edge over their competitors. For what is the use of new knowledge if it doesn't lead to new behaviours? Alas, once people change the way they behave, the economic theories become obsolete

This paradox is what prevented the communist revolution: the capitalist too read The Capital.

==We learn history not to predict the future, but to free ourselves from the past== and imagine alternative destinies.

## Homo Sapiens Conquers the World
To understand the hypotetical relationship between Homo Sapiens and Homo Deus it's useful to study the relationship between Homo Sapiens and animals.

Homo Sapiens is currently exploiting animals disregarding their feeling, for exampe we raise pigs in tiny crates ignoring their clear signs of frustration and even despair.
==Animals have feelings shaped by needs that aren't necessary any longer for survival==, but they are still felt subjectively.

What allowed humans to dominate the world was not their superiority in intelligence or tool making: there doesn't seem to be a strong correlation between human intelligence and its control on the world, on the contrary due to the welfare state the average human nowadays is less intelligent that the average human twenty thousand years ago.

==Humans conquered the world because they could cooperate flexibly in large groups==. We could do this thanks to **intersubjective experiences**: other than our subjective experiences and the objective reality there is an intersubjective level, that is the aggregate of the belief of many humans.
Money, nations and religion are all intersubjective entities.

People constantly reinforce each other's beliefs until you have no choice but to believe what others believe (ideologia dominante di Adorno).

> To study history means to watch the spinning and unravelling of these webs, and to realise that what seems to people in one age the most important thing in life becomes utterly meaningless to their descendants.

All human actions are guided by the dominant intersubjective experiences, that's why to understand the future we have to understand these fictions that give meaning to the world.

## Homo Sapiens Gives Meaning to the World
The strength of those fictional entities is the extent to which they can coordinate human actions: when people believed in the pharaoh they built dams and droughts indeed became rare.

Monotheism has the infantile attitude of believing that everything happens because of humans, polytheist religion having multiple forces at play accepted much more easily that something happened for causes unrelated to men.

==The intersubjective fictions allow us to cooperate, but they also determine our goals==, so our cooperation could be aiming to futile goals.
A school principal may aim to have good average grades, but is that the right way to measure a school's success?

Every society tells its members that they need to follow some superhuman law. Why are human rights sacred?

In Zen Buddhism it is said that "if you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him". Which means that you have to free yourself from the rigid rules of the institutionalised buddhism.
==Challenge the dogmas, because they are created by men==

The obsession with **growth** characterizes only he modern world. ==Capitalism became a religion when it stated that economic growth is the supreme value==. We see the obsession with growth even in modern games: levelling, expanding your empire, upgrading your gear; compare that with classical games like chess.

When we killed God we had to find meaning for our existence and thus came **humanism**.
==Humanism commands us to create meaning for ourselves==. When Nietzsche said "God is dead" he meant that God lost its status as creator of values: we can now live without God very easily, in the Middle Ages instead without God you had no source of political and moral authority.

We see the shift to humanism also in the growing focus on the character's feelings and journey.

One of the issues of humanism is comparing the value of communal experiences (e.g. traditions) with individual experiences.

Communism states that we cannot think of the individual experiences in isolation without considering the context.

In the mid 1970s it happeared that the future belonged to socialism. Only the threat of nuclear war allowed the survival and prosperity of liberals.

> History is often shaped by small groups of forward-looking innovators rather than by the backward-looking masses

Communism was the first techno-religion in history: they promised salvation through technology and economics.

Idelogies collapse when they can't respond to the issues of the time, e.g. biologist invent the contraceptive pill and the Pope doesn't know what to do about it.

> Ask yourself: what was the most influential discovery, invention or creation of the twentieth century? [...] Now ask yourself: what was the most influential discovery, invention or creation of traditional religions such as Islam and Christianity in the twentieth century

## Homo Sapiens loses control
Liberals value individual liberty so much because they believe in free will, but scientific scrutiny is challenging this belief: understanding the mind ever more we see a lack of free will and a merely deterministic system.
The mind is an algorithm and as such can be replaced by a better (non-biological) algorithm.

Furthermore science is challenging also the belief in individualism: even our brain is not a single entity (e.g. the left and right hemispheres division). We have an experiencing self that lives our moment to moment and a **narrating self** that sums up our experiences and creates the narratives of memories.
Those 2 selves may have very different views of reality: for example 
- the **peak-end rule** (memories are formed collapsing the peaks of an experience and the end, disregarding the temporal duration and all the average moments).
- the **"Our Boys Didn't Die in Vain" syndrome**: the narrating self prefers to go on suffering in the future rather than admitting the uselessness of the past suffering. We always need to give meaning to suffering, at least we say it made me a better person

Those scientific discoveries of course won't destroy liberalism right away.

> Reality will be a mesh of biochemical and electronic algorithms, without clear borders, and without individual hubs

Human Augmentation will create biological castes destroying the foundations of liberalism.

A new religion is emerging: **dataism**. Dataism believes that everything can be seen as the flow and analysis of data, not only individuals, but also ecosystems, societies, the economy, ...
The religious aspect is that it believes that as much data as possible should flow as freely as possible.
Instead of having worth in itself human life has worth depending on its contribute to data flow.

Capitalism won over communism not because of ethical reasons, but because of its superior ability to distributedly analyse data (e.g. the price of bread is the result of the distributed calculation operated by millions of buyers and sellers).

The current political structure are ever more overwhelmed by the amount of data.

Dataism may sideline humans by shifting from a homo-centric to a data-centric view.

> When we think about the future, our horizons are usually constrained by present-day ideologies and social systems

The 3 questions that emerge from the book are:
- Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?
- What's more valuable - intelligence or consciousness?
- What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?
