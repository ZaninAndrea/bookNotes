## The New Human Agenda
The advancements made in the 20th century reduced greatly famine, sickness and wars: for every person that dies of human violence 2 do because of diabetes.

Having raised humanity above the beastly level of survival struggles, ==we will now aim to upgrade humans into gods==.

This inevitable quest will hugely change our social structure: new generations will have a much harder time replacing the older ones. 
Furthermore the prize of eternal life might spark conflict never hitherto seen.

Humans will also try to find the key to happiness, because what is an eternal life good for if you aren't happy? People are already trying to achieve happiness via chemical drugs.

All this book is of course only speculation, maybe politics or something else will stop this quest like they prevented the Atomic Holocaust.
The more information we acquire the less accurate the prediction becomes, because that information will lead to unpredictable futures. This is the **paradox of knowledge**:

> Imagine, for example, that one day experts decipher the basic laws of the economy. Once this happens, banks, governments, investors and customer  will begin to use this knowledge to act in novel ways, and gain an edge over their competitors. For what is the use of new knowledge if it doesn't lead to new behaviours? Alas, once people change the way they behave, the economic theories become obsolete

This paradox is what prevented the communist revolution: the capitalist too read The Capital.

==We learn history not to predict the future, but to free ourselves from the past== and imagine alternative destinies.

## Homo Sapiens Conquers the World
To understand the hypotetical relationship between Homo Sapiens and Homo Deus it's useful to study the relationship between Homo Sapiens and animals.

Homo Sapiens is currently exploiting animals disregarding their feeling, for exampe we raise pigs in tiny crates ignoring their clear signs of frustration and even despair.
==Animals have feelings shaped by needs that aren't necessary any longer for survival==, but they are still felt subjectively.

What allowed humans to dominate the world was not their superiority in intelligence or tool making: there doesn't seem to be a strong correlation between human intelligence and its control on the world, on the contrary due to the welfare state the average human nowadays is less intelligent that the average human twenty thousand years ago.

==Humans conquered the world because they could cooperate flexibly in large groups==. We could do this thanks to **intersubjective experiences**: other than our subjective experiences and the objective reality there is an intersubjective level, that is the aggregate of the belief of many humans.
Money, nations and religion are all intersubjective entities.

People constantly reinforce each other's beliefs until you have no choice but to believe what others believe (ideologia dominante di Adorno).

> To study history means to watch the spinning and unravelling of these webs, and to realise that what seems to people in one age the most important thing in life becomes utterly meaningless to their descendants.

All human actions are guided by the dominant intersubjective experiences, that's why to understand the future we have to understand these fictions that give meaning to the world.

## Homo Sapiens Gives Meaning to the World
The strength of those fictional entities is the extent to which they can coordinate human actions: when people believed in the pharaoh they built dams and droughts indeed became rare.

Monotheism has the infantile attitude of believing that everything happens because of humans, polytheist religion having multiple forces at play accepted much more easily that something happened for causes unrelated to men.

==The intersubjective fictions allow us to cooperate, but they also determine our goals==, so our cooperation could be aiming to futile goals.
A school principal may aim to have good average grades, but is that the right way to measure a school's success?
