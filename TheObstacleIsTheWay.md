# The obstacle is the way - The timeless art of turning trials into triumph, Ryan Holiday

## Preface
- Marcus Aurelius, the last of the Five Good Emperors, took the time to write for himself
- "Our actions may be impeded... but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions. Because we can accomodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purpouses the obstacles to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way"
- most of us sit frozen before the many obstacles that lie ahead of us, but some people turn those obstacles into launching pads
- for those people obstacles are fuel for their ambition
- this book's aim is to show you how to turn negative situations into positive ones, not through optimism, but through creativtu and opportunism.
Not: this is not so bad. But: I can make this good
- whithin every obstacle is an opportunity to improve our condition. Remember that people before you already did this: they seized that opportunity
- Objective judgement, unselfish action and willing acceptance, that's all you need

## Perception
Our perceptions can be a source of strength or a weakness. It can be a strength only if we learn to limit our passions, that way we divide reliable signals from deceptive ones.

### The discipline of perception
- Where one sees a crisis another can see opportunity
- we choose to give in to feelings or to stay cool-headed
- our perceptions are still tuned to recognize threats that no longer exist, but we can learn to filter them
- when faced with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle we must try:
    - to be objective
    - to control emotions and keep an even keel
    - to choose to see the good in a situation
    - to steady our nerves
    - to ignore what distrubs or limits others
    - to place things in perspective
    - to revert to the present moment
    - to focus on what can be controlled

### Recognize your power
- we decide what we will make of each and every situation, how we will react
- through our perception of events, we are complicit in the creation of every obstacle

### Steady your nerves
- whatever you do in life if you want to succeed you will face obstacles, it will be hard, there will be people trying to stop you
- but there is always a countermove, if we are steady and cool headed, if we resist the temptation to mend our bad feeling, if we instead accept that it will be hard and refuse to stop

### Control your emotions
- the first astronauts were trained more than anything else not to panic
- John Glenn, the first American astronaur to orbit Earth, spent nearly a day in space keeping his heart rate under 100 beats/minute
- real strength lies in control, or domestication of one's emotion, not in pretending they don't exist
- we defeat emotions with logic

### Practice objectivity
- To paraphrase Nietzsche, sometimes being superficial - taking things only at first glance - is the most profound approach
- objectivity means removing "you" - the subjective part - from the equation

### Alter your perspective
- - the task is not to ignore fear, but to explain it away
- perspective has 2 definitions:
    - context: a sense of the larger picture of the world
    - framing: an individual's uniqeu way to look at the world
- our perspective, how we interpret the events of life changes everything
    - E.g. job interviews are often viewed as a solution to our problem of finding a job, whereas they really are a solution to the employeers problem of finding and employee. Changing perspective relieves us from the tyranny of being picked and the fear of rejection

### Is it up to you?
- always ask yourself "Is there a chance?", because if there is a chance you can work to make it happen
- to know where to focus your efforts you need 3 things:
    - the serenity to accept what you cannot change
    - the courage to change the things you can
    - the wisdom to know the difference

### Live the present moment
- focus on the present moment, not the monsters tha may or may not be ahead

### Think differently
- Believe in yourself and in your capabilities, because even though what we believe isn't bound to come true it surely influences what will come true.
- an enterpreneur is someone with faith in their ability to make something where there was nothing before

### Finding the opportunity
- We tend to label everything that doesn't comply to our vision of how the world should be as detrimental to us, but if we can push past this first impulse we can find the opportunity inside every obstacle:
    - Bad boss: an opportunity to take more risks knowing that you can alwways quit, you would have done that anyway
    - bad business decision: you had a hypothesis and it was wrong, learn from it, like  scientist would

### Prepare to act
The worst thing to happen is never the event, it's the vent + you losing your head, while the former is out of your control, the latter is in your control

## Action
- Every action has to be in the service of the whole
- our actions define us

### The discipline of action
- Many times we recognize the obstacle and the possible solutions, but we fail to act, we think that maybe the obstacle will vanish by itself
- it doesn't matter what you are given, it matters how you use it
    - people have overcame obstacles far greater than yours: physical disabilities, racial discrimination, ...
- faced with obstacles we don't give up, because we have something to do and the only way to do it is through action

### Get moving
- when you do nothing you accomplish nothing
- first get started, somewhere, anywhere, then try harder, because you know you can
- be deliberate, but always moving forward
- just because the conditions are perfect, doesn't mean you get to do nothing
